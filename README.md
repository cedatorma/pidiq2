Making PIDIQ possible in R. In short, PIDIQ is an image-analysis based, non-destructive, efficient, and reproducible approach for quantifying microbial pathogen-plant disease/immunity eliciting responses. 

PIDIQ2 is inspired by the original PIDIQ ImageJ macro, see [Laflamme et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27996374/), but its functionality has been expended for large-scale screening, allowing for the analysis of multiple-plant images, and provides a set of helper-GUIs simplify make image-preprocessing.
