Description: This package is designed for quantifying plant-pathogen disease and immunity elicitation phenotypes using images taken from screening experiments.
	It is a substantially expanded version of an earlier ImageJ macro (see PMID: 27996374) which incorporates with image-segmentation algorithms to work 
	with multiple-plant images and reduce spurious background-noise, and includes additional helper functions for a nicely integrated workflow.
